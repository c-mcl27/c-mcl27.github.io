  <h1>Charlotte's Life</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Charlotte. I was born on the 27th of December, 2005. I grew up learning Irish and went to a Gaelscoil until I was 12 years old. I attended an all-girls secondary school before graduating and finishing my Leaving Certificate in 2024. I then did a Film & TV Production PLC in my hometown before moving across the country for college. Now I am studying Computer Science in university and I absolutely adore it. My goal is to get a degree in Computer Science and to work in various places around the world!
