  <h1>Charlotte's Life</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Charlotte. I was born on the 27th of December, 2005. I grew up learning Irish and went to a Gaelscoil until I was 12 years old. I attended an all-girls secondary school before graduating and finishing my Leaving Certificate in 2024. I then did a Film & TV Production PLC in my hometown before moving across the country for college. Now I am studying Computer Science in university and I absolutely adore it. My goal is to get a degree in Computer Science and to work in various places around the world!

    I had a lot of hobbies when I was younger, some of which have carried through to adulthood. My favourite hobbies when I was younger included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drawing</li>
    <li>Reading</li>
    <li>Swimming</li>
    <li>Theatre</li>
    <li>Playing Instruments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Nowadays I have less time for passtimes, but I still try to keep as many extra-curriculars going as possible. I think it is an amazing way to make new friends who have the same interests as you have. My current favourite hobby is Theatre, which is something I have been doing for a long time. I started theatre when I was 4 years old, and have been part of many theatre societies and shows since. This year, I have joined the musical theatre society in college and am currently rehearsing for my first college mini musical, Cabaret!
